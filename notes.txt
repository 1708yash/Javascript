js is a dynamically written language

variables: are the boxes to occupy the memory

Declaring variables:
identifiers   operator literal
let             =         'a',4, (literal can be anything that is allowed under that identifier)
var                       (can not start with a number)
const 

js is case sensitive( Yash and yash are different)

var : comes from ES6 and is not usually used much
const : cant be changed through the code
let
